# Forecasting British Automobile Stocks' Price-Trends with ARIMA

### Introduction
This project seeks to determine how market-volatility affects the short-term future price-trends of three British car-manufacturers' stocks - TATA Motors, BMW and Rolls-Royce.

### Literature Review 
Researchers’ perspectives regarding the effectiveness of ARIMA-based share-price forecasting has shifted in recent years. Despite ARIMA’s historical popularity in time-series modelling (Zhang, 2003), current multi-method quantitative studies investigating share-price and demand-modelling have outlined that the technique’s prediction-power and forecast-accuracy were inferior to deep-learning’s (Bousqaoui,
Slimani and Achchab, 2021; Panchal, Ferdouse and Sultana, 2024; Siami-Namini, Tavakoli and Namin, 2018; Adebiyi et al., 2014).

While this consensus on ARIMA’s shortcomings is not universal, with
Ahammad et al.’s (2024) investigation into Apex Food shares demonstrating the contrary, these findings still illustrate ARIMA’s challenges with modelling prices in agitated markets.
